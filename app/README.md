# Patrick Emery Site SPA

## Why
I wanted to use S3 to host my website, I wanted to use Vue and Webpack for a project, and I wanted to use Github Actions for AWS deployment. Some lambda scripts will be added to this repository in the future for managing, e.g. Contract submissions and such.

This website is a personal project and the source is shared as a portfolio piece. 

## What
This is a single-page website built using Vue to manage components, vue-router to essentially have pages within one page, and Webpack to condense everything down into one JS file. 

It also uses [Bootstrap Darkly from Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/darkly/) for theme and [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for icons. In the future, I may roll a custom Bootstrap theme, but for now Darkly works wonderfully.
